what is pytorch?
PyTorch is a widely-used deep learning framework known for its popularity in research. 
It allows developers to write efficient deep learning code in Python, capable of running on GPUs for faster processing. 
PyTorch provides access to numerous pre-built deep learning models through Torch Hub and torchvision. 
Its capabilities extend to the entire deep learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, modeling, and deployment in applications or the cloud. 
Initially developed by Facebook (now Meta), PyTorch has become a staple tool in the machine learning community.

why pytorch?
PyTorch is a popular open-source deep learning framework primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR).
PyTorch uses dynamic computational graphs, which means that the graph is built on-the-fly as operations are executed. 
This allows for more flexibility and ease of debugging compared to static computational graphs used by frameworks like TensorFlow.
PyTorch is designed to be Pythonic, meaning it integrates well with Python and follows Python programming principles closely. 
This makes it easy to use and learn for Python developers.

what is tensor?
A tensor is a mathematical object that generalizes scalars, vectors, and matrices to higher dimensions.
In the context of deep learning and frameworks like PyTorch, a tensor is a multi-dimensional array or a generalized matrix.
Tensors can have any number of dimensions, making them capable of representing a wide range of data types and structures.
